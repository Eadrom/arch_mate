# arch_mate
PKGBUILD's for MATE in Arch Linux's [community] repo

* Update to latest stable upstream:  1.14.x - 1st pass complete; need to make another pass now that dev version 1.15 has come out to make sure I include any final 1.14 updates
* Migrate .install scripts into PKGBUILD's to take advantage of hook system in pacman 5 - Complete
* Merge the separate GTK2 and GTK3 PKGBUILD's into one split-package PKGBUILD - 1st pass complete, still working out how dependencies should be managed for this kind of a split package
* Build test all packages - Not Yet Started
