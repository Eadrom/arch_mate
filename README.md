# arch_mate

* Update to latest stable upstream:  1.15.x 
* Migrate .install scripts into PKGBUILD's to take advantage of hook system in pacman 5 - Complete
* GTK3 PKGBUILD only
* Build test all packages - everything in ./order is more or less tested. The methodology is to run them in a vm for a minute or so.
