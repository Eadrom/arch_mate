# arch_mate
PKGBUILD's for MATE in Arch Linux's [community] repo

* Updated to latest stable upstream:  1.15.x 
* GTK3 PKGBUILD only
* Build test all packages - everything in ./order is more or less tested. The methodology is to run them in a vm for a minute or so.


Known Issues: cannot make mate-sensors-applet as it needs a nvidia package.
